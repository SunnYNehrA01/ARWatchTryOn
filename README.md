# ARWatchTryOn ⌚🖐️

ARWatchTryOn is an Augmented Reality (AR) application built using **Unity** that allows users to virtually try on a watch by simulating a **3D watch model on a 3D hand model**.  
The project is designed to enhance the online watch-buying experience by letting customers visualize how a watch looks and fits **before making a purchase**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Buying watches online often lacks one critical factor — **visual fit and style on the wrist**.  
ARWatchTryOn solves this problem by providing an immersive AR-based try-on experience where:

- A realistic **3D watch model** is aligned onto a **3D hand model**
- Users can view the watch from different angles
- The experience mimics how the watch would look in real life

This project was developed as a **proof-of-concept for AR-based retail experiences**, especially for the fashion and accessories industry.
